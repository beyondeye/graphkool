# An introduction to GraphKool
A collection of Kotlin extension functions and utilities around [GraphQL-java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java ) for reducing its
verbosity:
The original GraphQL hello world example written with GraphQL-java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {    
        GraphQLObjectType queryType = newObject()
                        .name("helloWorldQuery")
                        .field(newFieldDefinition()
                                .type(GraphQLString)
                                .name("hello")
                                .staticValue("world"))
                        .build();
        
        GraphQLSchema schema = GraphQLSchema.newSchema()
                        .query(queryType)
                        .build();
        Map<String, Object> result = (Map<String, Object>) new GraphQL(schema).execute("{hello}").getData();

        System.out.println(result);
        // Prints: {hello=world}
    }
}
```
with GraphKool can be written:
```kotlin
fun main() {
            val queryType = newObject("helloWorldQuery")
                    .field("hello"..GraphQLString staticValue "world")

            val schema = newGraphQLSchema(query = queryType)
            val result = newGraphQL(schema).execute("{hello}").data as Map<String, Any>
            println(result)
}
```
